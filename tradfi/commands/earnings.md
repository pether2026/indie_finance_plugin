# Earnings Update

Create an institutional-quality earnings update report (8-12 pages) for the target company.

## Context

- User request: $ARGUMENTS
- Today's date: !`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`

## Data Source Priority

### Layer 1: MCP
1. **alpha-vantage** — earnings call transcripts, earnings calendar
2. **yahoo-finance** — earnings results, financial statements, analyst estimates
3. **financial-modeling-prep** — detailed estimates, historical earnings, analyst ratings

### Layer 2: Web Search
- seekingalpha.com for earnings transcripts
- finance.yahoo.com/earnings
- sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar for filings

### Layer 3: Chrome CDP
- Seeking Alpha (may require login for full transcripts)
- Earnings call replay pages

## Critical: Use Latest Data

**BEFORE STARTING — COMPLETE THESE 4 STEPS:**
1. **CHECK TODAY'S DATE** — write down the current date
2. **SEARCH FOR LATEST** — use MCP tools or web search: "[Company] latest earnings results"
3. **VERIFY THE DATE** — confirm earnings release is within last 3 months
4. **CHECK TRANSCRIPT DATE** — verify transcript date matches release date

Do NOT rely on training data for earnings figures. Always fetch live data.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection (30-60 min)
1. Query yahoo-finance MCP for latest earnings results and financial statements
2. Query alpha-vantage MCP for earnings call transcript and calendar
3. Query financial-modeling-prep MCP for estimates and analyst ratings
4. Fall back to web search if MCP data is incomplete
5. Use Chrome CDP for content behind login walls

### Phase 2: Beat/Miss Analysis
For each key metric, calculate:

| Metric | Consensus | Actual | Beat/Miss | Delta | Delta % |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Revenue | | | | | |
| EPS | | | | | |
| Gross Margin | | | | | |
| EBITDA | | | | | |
| [Key metric 1] | | | | | |

- Lead with whether company beat or missed
- Quantify variances ("Revenue beat by $120M or 3%")
- Explain WHY results differed from expectations

### Phase 3: Analysis
- Segment/geographic/product breakdown
- Margin trends (QoQ and YoY)
- Management guidance: maintained, raised, or lowered?
- Key quotes from earnings call
- Updated forward estimates (old vs new, with rationale)

### Phase 4: Chart Generation
Create 8-12 charts using Python (matplotlib/seaborn):
- Quarterly revenue progression
- Quarterly EPS progression
- Margin trends over time
- Revenue by segment/geography
- Beat/miss history
- Estimate revisions
- Valuation context (P/E, EV/EBITDA over time)

### Phase 5: Report Assembly
Structure (8-12 pages):
- **Page 1**: Summary — rating, price target, key takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
- **Pages 2-3**: Detailed results analysis with beat/miss tables
- **Pages 4-5**: Key metrics, guidance analysis, management commentary
- **Pages 6-7**: Updated investment thesis assessment
- **Pages 8-10**: Valuation and revised estimates
- **Pages 11-12**: Appendix (optional)

### Phase 6: Quality Check
- Verify all numbers against primary sources
- Ensure citations with specific documents and dates
- Check that charts match data in tables

## Output

- **Primary**: `{Ticker}_Q{Quarter}_{Year}_Earnings_Update.md` — full report with embedded charts
- **Secondary**: Updated estimate table (can be separate .xlsx if requested)

## Citation Requirements

Every figure and table MUST cite source with specific document and date:
```
Source: Q3 2024 10-Q filed November 8, 2024; Company earnings release
```

Include a "SOURCES & REFERENCES" section at end listing all materials with URLs.
