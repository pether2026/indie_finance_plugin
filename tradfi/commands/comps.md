# Comparable Company Analysis

Build an institutional-grade comps table for the target company and its peers.

## Context

- User request: $ARGUMENTS
- Today's date: !`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`

## Data Source Priority

Fetch data using the three-layer fallback:

### Layer 1: MCP Data Sources (preferred)
1. **yahoo-finance** — stock quotes, key statistics, financial statements, company info
2. **financial-modeling-prep** — detailed financials, ratios, enterprise value, peer comparison
3. **alpha-vantage** — technical indicators, additional fundamentals

### Layer 2: Web Search
- finance.yahoo.com, macrotrends.net for financial data
- SEC EDGAR for filings

### Layer 3: Chrome CDP
- For pages requiring login or dynamic rendering

Always annotate: "Source: [source name]" on each data point.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Peer Group
- Confirm the target company ticker
- If peers not specified, identify 4-8 comparable companies based on: sector, business model, market cap range, geographic footprint
- Ask user to confirm the peer list before proceeding

### Step 2: Gather Financial Data
For each company, retrieve:
- **Revenue** (LTM or latest FY), revenue growth YoY
- **Gross Profit** and Gross Margin
- **EBITDA** and EBITDA Margin
- **Net Income** and EPS
- **Market Cap**, **Enterprise Value**
- **Free Cash Flow** (if available)

Query yahoo-finance MCP first. Fill gaps with financial-modeling-prep MCP, then alpha-vantage MCP. Fall back to web search if MCP data is incomplete.

### Step 3: Show Inputs for Confirmation
Present the raw data block to the user. Confirm all figures and their sources before building formulas. Do NOT build the entire sheet end-to-end without checkpoints.

### Step 4: Build the Excel Model
Use Python/openpyxl to create a standalone `.xlsx` file:

**Operating Metrics Section:**
- Company, Revenue, Revenue Growth, Gross Margin, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin
- Add industry-specific metrics if relevant (Rule of 40 for SaaS, ROE for financials, etc.)

**Valuation Multiples Section:**
- Market Cap, Enterprise Value, EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E
- Add FCF Yield, PEG, or other multiples as appropriate

**Statistics Block (for each section):**
- Maximum, 75th Percentile, Median, 25th Percentile, Minimum
- Apply to comparable metrics (ratios, margins, multiples) — not to absolute size metrics

**Formula Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Every derived value MUST be an Excel formula referencing input cells: `cell.value = "=E7/C7"`
- NEVER write pre-computed Python values: `cell.value = 0.687` is WRONG
- Only hardcoded values = raw input data; every hardcode gets a cell comment with its source

### Step 5: Format and Polish
- Blue text for hardcoded inputs, black for formulas
- Section headers: dark blue background, white bold text
- Column headers: light blue background, black bold text
- Statistics rows: light grey background
- Percentages to 1 decimal, multiples to 1 decimal with "x" suffix, dollar amounts with thousands separator
- Uniform column widths, consistent row heights, center-aligned metrics

### Step 6: Notes & Methodology
Add a Notes section (separate sheet or below data) documenting:
- Data sources for each company
- Time period covered
- EBITDA calculation method
- Any adjustments or exclusions

## Output

- **Primary**: `{Target}_Comps_{YYYYMMDD}.xlsx` — full comps table with formulas
- **Secondary**: Brief Markdown summary with key findings (median multiples, where target sits vs peers)

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] All companies are truly comparable
- [ ] Data from consistent time periods
- [ ] Units clearly labeled (millions/billions)
- [ ] ALL formulas reference cells, not hardcoded values
- [ ] Every hardcoded input has a cell comment citing source
- [ ] Statistics cover Max, 75th, Median, 25th, Min
- [ ] Margin sanity: Gross > EBITDA > Net
- [ ] Multiple reasonableness: EV/Rev 0.5-20x, EV/EBITDA 8-25x, P/E 10-50x
- [ ] No #DIV/0!, #REF!, #N/A errors
- [ ] Date stamp is current
